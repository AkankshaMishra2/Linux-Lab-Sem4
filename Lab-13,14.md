# Lab 13 & 14: File Ownership and Permissions in Linux

## Objective
Understand and implement file ownership and permission management using `chown` and `chmod`.

## Commands and Concepts

### 1. File Ownership Management with `chown`

#### Basic `chown` Usage
Change file owner:
```bash
sudo chown operator1 testfile.txt
```
Verify ownership:
```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

#### Change Owner and Group
```bash
sudo chown operator1:operator2 testfile.txt
```

#### Recursive Ownership Change
```bash
sudo chown -R operator1:operator1 testdirectory/
```

#### Reference Option
```bash
sudo chown --reference=referencefile.txt targetfile.txt
```

### 2. File Permissions Management with `chmod`

#### Numeric Mode (Octal)
Set read, write, execute for owner:
```bash
chmod 700 testfile.txt
```
Set read/write for owner, read for group/others:
```bash
chmod 644 testfile.txt
```

#### Symbolic Mode
Add execute for owner:
```bash
chmod u+x testfile.txt
```
Remove write for group:
```bash
chmod g-w testfile.txt
```
Add read for others:
```bash
chmod o+r testfile.txt
```
Set multiple permissions:
```bash
chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o+r testfile.txt
```

#### Recursive Permission Change
```bash
chmod -R 755 testdirectory/
```

#### Special Permissions
Set SUID:
```bash
chmod u+s testfile.txt
```
Set SGID:
```bash
chmod g+s testdirectory/
```
Set Sticky Bit:
```bash
chmod +t testdirectory/
```

### 3. Combining `chown` and `chmod`
Change ownership and permissions:
```bash
sudo chown operator1:operator2 testfile.txt
chmod 750 testfile.txt
```

### 4. Advanced Options

#### Preserve Root
```bash
sudo chmod --preserve-root -R 777 /directory
```

#### Verbose Option
```bash
chmod -v 644 testfile.txt
```

#### Changes Option
```bash
chmod -c 644 testfile.txt
```

### Verifying Permissions and Ownership
```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

## Conclusion
You learned to manage file ownership and permissions using `chown` and `chmod`, essential for Linux system administration.
